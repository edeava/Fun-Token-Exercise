# Fun-Token-Exercise

## Full stack Blockchain engineer technical assessment

### Introduction
Using a language of your choice provide a solution to the following problem which will be
discussed as part of the technical follow up interview.

### Exercise
Given a list of deposit addresses and a list of erc20 token addresses sweep all native and erc20
tokens in the list from the deposit addresses to a single address.
Extra bonus points for optimizing gas fees whilst mitigating risk.
Assume the following:
- All addresses in the list are derived from a master keypair (BIP32).
- Code has access to the master keypair.

### Deliverable:
- Push your solution to a private git repository and grant access to us when youâ€™re happy
with it.
- Include a README.md listing prerequisites and simple instructions on how to build and
run the application.
- Feel free to include further documentation if you have time and feel it necessary (but this
is not a requirement).

### Tips:
- This is a fairly open assignment in terms of how you structure the solution. You will be
judged on the overall quality of the code, particularly in terms of:
- Clean, succinct, self-documenting code
- Package and class structure
- Adherence to OOP best practices and patterns
- Keep your solution simple.
- Feel free to use external libraries where needed
- Use libraries and frameworks that you are familiar with - it is not recommended that you
use this exercise as an opportunity to try out some new technology you've never used
before.
